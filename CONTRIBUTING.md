# Contributing

## Goals

This tool is intentionally straightforward. If you are interested in adding large or complex features, another tool or a fork would probably be a better fit.

That being said, bug reports, bug fixes, output improvements, best practice updates, or other things like that are welcomed.

## Style

Code is formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Additionally, imports are grouped and sorted. [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) can help with that.
